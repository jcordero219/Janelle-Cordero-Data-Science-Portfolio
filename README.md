- [March Data Crunch Madness Competition](): In a competition sponsorede by Deloitte, I was tasked with predicting the probabilities of the outcome of each NCAA Men's March Madness tournament matchup. I used extensive data pre-processing, feature engineering, validation, and classification modeling to predict ecery possible matchup.
