# **Janelle Cordero's Data Science Portfolio**

##### I am a recent graduate of the M.S. in Applied Statistics and Decision Making program from Fordham University. This repository includes machine learning projects and assignments that I completed throughout my coursework.

- [March Data Crunch Madness Competition](https://github.com/jcordero219/Janelle-Cordero-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/March%20Data%20Crunch%20Madness.ipynb): In a competition sponsored by Deloitte, I was tasked with predicting the probabilities of the outcome of each NCAA Men's March Madness tournament matchup. I used extensive data pre-processing, feature engineering, validation, and classification modeling to predict ecery possible matchup. I primarily used Pandas for data manipulation and SVM, logistic Regression, Random Forest, and kNN for classification. Please reload if prompted.

- [Predicting Hospital Readmission](https://github.com/jcordero219/Janelle-Cordero-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Predicting%20Hospital%20Readmission.ipynb): I worked in a team to predic hospital readmission within 30 days of a patient's discharge. Classification models used include Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, kNN, and a majority vote ensemble.

- [L2 Regularized Lihnear Regression from Scratch](https://github.com/jcordero219/Janelle-Cordero-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/L2%20Linear%20Regression%20from%20Scratch.ipynb): I coded L2 regularized linear regression without machine learning packages on an example dataset. I primarily used Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation. This code was done in Python 2.7.
